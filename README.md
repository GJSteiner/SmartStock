# SmartStock
 
This was the final capstone project for the TechElevator bootcamp I attended, created by myself and three other teammates. 

It is an application where users can create an account, log in, then create and play in a virtual environment where they can buy and sell stocks alongside other registered users. 

The application uses end of day prices from the stock market that are pulled from polygon.io's API.
